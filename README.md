## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
> It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Model overfitting can be reduced by using data augumentation.
- Model accuracy can be increased by using class imbalance.
- Using dropout layers can reduce overfitting.
- Increasing the number of epochs also increases accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- Mathpltlib
- Python
